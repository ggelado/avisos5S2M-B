                            We need to verify ownership of ggelado.github.io/avisos5S2M-B to start monitoring it with SecurityBot.

                            Please create a verification file:

                            File Location: ggelado.github.io/avisos5S2M-B/.well-known/securitybot-verification.txt
                            File Content: EJUHIDFcrDIZZJ51e10JTlSOVewhDs7u

                            Steps:
                            1. Create the directory: .well-known (if it doesn't exist)
                            2. Create a file named: securitybot-verification.txt
                            3. Add the verification code above as the file's content
                            4. Ensure the file is accessible at the URL above
                            5. Let me know when it's complete so I can verify

                            You can test if the file is accessible by visiting:
                            ggelado.github.io/avisos5S2M-B/.well-known/securitybot-verification.txt
